Custom PCGen
About
This is a custom version of PCGen.  It's lightly modified and greatly reduced to work better for the campaign(s) that I am active in.  That does not preclude it from being used in other manners.
Primarily the changes are:
 * Homebrew files and custom equipment
 * Great reduction in size
 * Slight stability increases

Instructions
* Install instructions at https://github.com/SpiderManAPV/customPCGen/releases
* If updating from any version prior to v0.1.1-4 it is strongly recommended that you uninstall the previous version before updating.  All future versions (should) be able to be directly copied over.  Doing so may reduce the benefits from reduced file size, however.
* It is strongly recommended that the PCGenDir option is selected on first run.
* To load up sources pre-approved for games I GM, load the Correct Sources.pcg file.
